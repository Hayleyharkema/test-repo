						<p>Our final project is called Lysternin; a rotating cube of light. The light is composed of seven rotating blocks that afford users the opprtunity to share and focus light as needed. This versatility allows the user to craft different lighting experiences to suit the ever-changing needs of co-working spaces. Lysternin is designed to encourage user interaction and sharing space.</p>

						<p class="margin-top"><em>My Role:</em> While working on Lysternin I primarily worked on the iterative side; making high quality marker sketches and foam prototypes. I also took the lead on the digital front by making all digital models and technical drafts.</p>

						<p class="margin-top">In the <em>early stages of development</em> my group iterated individually to prevent a narrow group focus. My initial sketches shown above took inspiration from the workspace and the decor. I borrowed conventions from the acrylic ceiling lamps, the table legs and the building's lamps and developed three designs. The two designs above were well received, however our group opted to choose a more interactive design to encourage patrons of the co-working space to <em>interact with one another.</em></p>

						<p class="margin-top">After our initial design sprint we narrowed our focus to <em>promote interaction.</em> We wanted our design to invoke a greater sense of community and connectedness. With a higher degree of interaction we sought to engage users and push them to <em>interact through the lamp together.</em> My teammate Izaak presented the idea of Lysternin and the interactive possibilities that we saw in the design, combined with the efficient material usage solidified our choice and we began to develop sketch models and high fidelity sketches.</p>

						<p>The final form was assembled using laser cut acrylic and hand machined aluminum. I arranged both the laser cutting and machining which included developing files using Corel Draw and providing accurate dimensioned drawings. The tall rectangular design gives the lamp a clean, very modern appeal that appears quiet until users move the platforms around and leave it in a state of disorder. This form also maximizes the amount of ambient light produced as it allows more surface area for the light to diffuse through.</p>

						<p class="margin-top">This project taught me a lot about rapid prototyping and how it is necessary to fail faster. We often had more ideas and directions than we could keep up with for this project so we had to develop fast ways of visualizing the designs so that we could evaluate them. Initially, we primarily sketched our ideas; a medium that I am very familiar with. As the project moved beyond sketching I struggled to work quickly though, because it was my first time using foam to prototype. This prevented the design from moving forward for a short time, so I practiced by making small scale sketch prototypes at home to explore different ways of shaping the material and become more familiar with the medium.</p>
