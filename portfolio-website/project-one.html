						<p class="margin-top" >product design: an interactive lamp created to share and direct light.</p>

						<h2>brief</h2>
						<p>This six week project challenged my team to create a lamp for a new SIAT space that would work with existing design conventions in the space. Additionally we could only use our assigned materials for the final model.</p>

						<p>Lysternin is a cube of light. An interactive table lamp designed with a strong focus on rotation as a key interaction. The light is composed of seven rotatable blocks that leverage the user's ability to direct the light in various forms. This versatility allows the user to craft different lighting experiences to suit different preferences. Lysternin is designed to encourage user interaction and sharing spaces.</p>

						<p>my role: while working on Lysternin I primarily worked on the iterative side; making high quality marker sketches and foam prototypes. I also took the lead on the digital front by making all digital models and technical drawings.</p>

						<p class="margin-top">My group decided to iterate individually through sketching and sketch models before selecting a design for prototyping. We learned to work quickly and to reject ideas quickly by using higher quality sketches and low quality sketch models. My designs drew inspiration from the space that the lamps were being designed for. My goal with this design decision was to make the design fit into the room harmoniously. Of the groups eight proposed designs, two of mine were selected for an initial prototype. However, the final models were based on my colleagueâ€™s design. </p>

						<p class="margin-top">With the final concept chosen, we iterated the design as a team to improve the aesthetics and the interactive aspect of the lamp. These changes included making the lamp taller and adding clear panels on the bottom of the rotating platforms. This allowed a lot more light to be produced and prevented the design from being too static. During this process I worked with one colleague to produce the models for each iteration using blue foam and thermoplastic.</p>

						<p>The final form was assembled by my colleague and I using laser cut acrylic and hand machined aluminum. I personally arranged both the laser cutting and machining which included developing files using Corel Draw and providing accurate dimensioned drawings.</p>

						<p class="margin-top">The tall rectangular design gives the lamp a clean, very modern appeal that appears quiet until users move the platforms around and leave it in a state of disorder. This form also maximizes the amount of ambient light produced as it allows more surface area for the light to diffuse through.</p>

						<p class="margin-top">This project taught me a lot about rapid prototyping and how it is necessary to fail faster. I am quite comfortable with sketching as a means of prototyping, so much of my initial iteration was marker based sketching. As the project moved beyond sketching I struggled to work quickly though because it was my first time using foam to prototype. This prevented the design from moving forward for a short time, so I practiced by making small scale sketch prototypes at home to explore different ways of shaping the material and become more familiar with the medium.</p>
