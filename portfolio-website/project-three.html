						<p class="margin-top first-margin"> Created as a project for a four month course and working in teams of three, we were given four weeks to complete a website for fictitious mountain rescue company, Kalmont Rescue. The website is built to inform visitors about the team, the mountain and the inherent risks of mountaineering whilst allowing the to easily access current updates.</p>

						<p>Our website is a fully responsive website targeting novice mountaineers with safety information whilst providing an accessible overview of useful news and updates for regular visitors who are on-the-go.</p>

						<p class="margin-top">Although my group lacked mobile deign experience, we sought to marry these two functions by providing all updates and news in an easy to use format that is optimized for mobile use because people looking for a quick update whilst on the mountain are more likely to have their mobile phone than any other forms of media. </p>

						<p><em>My Role:</em> My main role was developing the html and CSS markup. I also assisted in developing all of our wireframes using Axure and Adobe Illustrator.</p>

						<p class="margin-top">My group started our production by creating <em>wireframes.</em> One issue we had with this approach was that each person had a different idea of what the wireframes should entail. In order to get everyone on the same page we then made a sitemap to better illuminate <em>how we wanted the user to move through the website.</em> This map also served as a guide for the levels of immediacy that different goals possessed. We used the site map extensively in the our later wireframing, and development stages because it helped us to remember what our main trajectory for the project was as the idea evolved. </p>

						<p class="margin-top">With the initial wireframes completed we moved onto actually building out the website. The work was split so that one teammate lead the design and copy, another worked on the landing page, and I created the remaining pages. This method worked fairly well for us, however we ran into <em>issues consolidating our different code.</em> In the end we spent an entire afternoon patching things together and making sure that the different styles were working together. It was a difficult process and it taught all of us the value of collaborative workflow resources like git.</p>

						<p>Prior to this class I had no experience at all working with HTML and CSS, or even designing for web. I found that the group often ran into problems because we hadn't taken the time to really lay things out before we got into development. We used the sitemap and made sure to create updated wireframes often to alleviate this issue, but I have since learned to spend more time on the first phase of development when I can. Despite the challenges of our iterative process, I did learn a lot about writing HTML and CSS largely through self-instruction as I researched how to achieve certain effects. This way of learning by doing really helped me learn a lot and my coding skills definitely improved and evolved for the better.</p>

						<p class="margin-top">Our final website is clean and fully functioning across platforms. If I were to improve on thing about it, I would like to conduct more user studies, our one study was very successful and we learned a lot, but I would have liked to conduct at least one more at the end to see if our changes were effective.</p>
